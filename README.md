# Zebra Puzzle Solver

This is an exercise in programming complex logic. Although primarily intended
for entertainment, it provides solid examples of best practices for solving
problems with code.

## The Puzzle

There are several different version of the Zebra Puzzle (aka Einstein's
puzzle). The solutions provided in the repository are flexible enough to solve
them all. However, the goal is the most difficult version of the puzzle as
shown below.

1. There are five houses.
1. The Englishman lives in the red house.
1. The Spaniard owns the dog.
1. Coffee is drunk in the green house.
1. The Ukrainian drinks tea.
1. The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.
1. The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
1. Kools are smoked in the yellow house.
1. Milk is drunk in the middle house.
1. The Norwegian lives in the first house.
1. The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the
fox.
1. Kools are smoked in the house next to the house where the horse is kept.
1. The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
1. The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
1. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.

Now, who drinks water? Who owns the zebra?

In the interest of clarity, it must be added that each of the five houses is
painted a different color, and their inhabitants are of different national
extractions, own different pets, drink different beverages and smoke different
brands of American cigarets [sic]. One other thing: in statement 6, right means
your right.
